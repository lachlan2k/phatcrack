Preamble:

This project is inspired by the hard work of the nesfit/fitcrack team (https://github.com/nesfit/fitcrack/), and borrows many parts from the webadmin component.
At the time of forking these components, they are licensed under the MIT license, and as such, Phatcrack is also MIT licensed.

I extend my sincere thanks to the Fitcrack team for their project, and publishing it under an open-source license.

The original LICENSE & AUTHORS of the Fitcrack webadmin can be found here:
* https://github.com/nesfit/fitcrack/blob/f3d8a5b20664f2cf02c257364d147964d5a99314/webadmin/LICENSE
* https://github.com/nesfit/fitcrack/blob/f3d8a5b20664f2cf02c257364d147964d5a99314/webadmin/AUTHORS

The Docker images also install dev libraries, headers and dependencies from the Hashcat project, which is also MIT licensed.

Hashcat's LICENSE & AUTHORS can be found here:
